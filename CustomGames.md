# Rules of Play

## City of Mist Edition

*Dripping neon. The rain-soaked streets hum with rumor and danger. These are the unspoken codes whispered in the alleys and etched in the fog—rules that keep the game sharp, cinematic, and alive.*

### Player Principles
- **Where are you?** Ground yourself in the scene—fog curling around your ankles, neon signs flickering above. Know your place in the story.
- **What are you doing?** Declare bold, immediate action. Don’t suggest; commit.
- **Speak in the present tense.** You *are* the Mythos. You *are* the Legend. Act like it.
- **Trust the table.** Heroes, misfits, and monsters—we’re all building the same story.
- **Stop negotiating dice.** Moves are triggered by story. Roll when the fiction demands it.
- **No playtesting aloud.** Don’t workshop the move; make the move.
- **Don’t act by committee.** Your legend speaks in your voice.
- **Talk on your turn, not others’.** Let every spotlight burn bright.

> **Remember:** *The dice don’t make the story. They bend with it.*

### Master of Ceremonies Principles
- **Why help your players?** You don’t. You challenge them. You tempt them. You push the Mystery forward.
- **Don’t describe for them.** State what the world does, not how the crew reacts.
- **Limit exposition on rolls.** A move is a spark, not a monologue.
- **Don’t forecast the future.** No hints, no warnings. The city reveals itself only when stepped into.
- **Speak in the present tense.** Let NPCs breathe, threaten, plead—all right now.

### Shared Language
*Fog thickens when words get soft.* Avoid:
- seems to
- kind of
- sort of
- likely
- maybe / may be
- probably has

*Don’t ask permission. Declare intention.*
Avoid:
- Can I/we…?
- Could I/we…?
- If I/we…?

Act. The City will answer.

## Delta Green Edition

*A cold directive stamped in black ink. No flair. No neon glow. These are field rules—burned into memory, whispered between agents, and followed because survival depends on it.*

### Agent Protocols
- **Where are you?** Maintain situational awareness. Note exits, cover, assets, and threats.
- **What are you doing?** State clear, immediate actions. No hemming. No hypotheticals.
- **Speak in the present tense.** The op is happening *now.* Stay focused.
- **Operate with trust.** Trust your handler. Trust your cell. Doubt everything else.
- **Stop negotiating mechanics.** This is not training. When the roll is called, make it.
- **Do not playtest aloud.** Commit. Hesitation kills.
- **Do not take your turn by committee.** An agent must act, not wait for consensus.
- **Control your comms.** Speak on your turn. Keep radio discipline.

> **Note:** *The dice do not save you. They only record what happened.*

### Handler Protocols
- **Your job is not to save them.** Present the world honestly. Let their decisions carry consequences.
- **Do not describe their reactions or internal states.** Trust the agents to know their own minds.
- **Limit exposition on rolls.** Rolls resolve actions, not briefing packets.
- **Do not forecast outcomes.** No warnings. No foreshadowing. Let agents walk into what they choose.
- **Speak in the present tense.** The unnatural waits for no one.

### Language Restrictions
Vague language gets agents killed. Do not use:
- seems to
- kind of
- sort of
- likely
- probably has
- maybe / may be

Do not ask permission. This is not a request chain. Avoid:
- Can I/we…?
- Could I/we…?
- If I/we…?

Declare the action. Accept the consequences. Complete the mission.
