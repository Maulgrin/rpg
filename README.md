# Table Etiquette & Best Practices

## Player Suggestions

### Where are you?

Always orient yourself in the fiction. Visualize the scene. Where are you standing? Who’s near you? What’s the environment telling you? This keeps your decisions grounded and helps everyone share the same mental picture.

### What are you doing?

Don’t drift into hypotheticals. Describe what your character is actively doing **right now**. Clear action leads to clearer outcomes and smoother narrative flow.

### Think and speak in present tense as your character.

Use **“I draw the blade”** rather than **“I would draw the blade.”**  
Use **“I push through the alley”** rather than **“I’d like to walk down the alley.”**

This keeps the fiction alive and immediate.

### Are we playing in a high-trust environment?

Trust that everyone at the table GM and players are collaborating to create a great story, not trying to “win.” That trust frees you to act boldly, fail honestly, and stay immersed.

### Stop negotiating dice every turn.

When it’s time to roll, roll.

- Don’t haggle modifiers.  
- Don’t attempt meta-maneuvers.  
- Don’t re-frame the move to gain mechanical leverage.

Make your move in the fiction and let the mechanics naturally follow.

### Don’t “playtest” your move aloud.

Avoid test statements like:

> “If I did this, would it count as…?”

Commit to action. Act; don’t workshop.

### Don’t take your turn by committee.

It’s **your** turn. **Your** choices.

You may consult briefly **in character**, but the spotlight belongs to you. Own it.

### Talk on your turn—not on others’.

Let players make their own decisions. Keep crosstalk low. Give each person space to shine without being directed, corrected, or coached mid-scene.

### Note

**The dice are not the game.**  
They are sparks/prompts that inspire roleplay, drama, and consequences. The story matters more than the numbers.

## Game Master Suggestions

### Why do you have to help your players?

You don’t. Your job is not to solve problems for them. Set the stage, portray the world honestly, and let their choices matter. Challenge them by presenting clear information and real consequences.

Do not over narrate and do not take away player agency.

### Don’t describe for the characters.

Tell them what the world does, not what they feel, think, or choose.

- Avoid: *“You realize this makes you nervous.”*  
- Instead: *“The floorboards creak underfoot, and the hallway goes silent.”*

### Limit exposition triggered by rolls.

Rolls resolve **immediate action**, not lore dumps. Keep outcomes sharp, focused, and tethered to the moment.

### Don’t explain the future.

Never tell players what might happen if they choose X.

- Avoid: *“If you go down the alley, something bad could happen.”*

Present the fiction, not predictions. Let them discover outcomes through action.

### Think and speak in present tense as the NPCs.

When portraying NPCs, embody them in the moment.

- *“I stare you down and fold my arms”* is more engaging than  
  *“He would stare you down.”*

### If you must use a map…

If you must use a map, **do not place any locations, tokens, or NPCs the characters cannot currently see**.  
Only reveal what is in their line of sight or immediate awareness.

## Shared Suggestions for Players and Game Masters

### Avoid softening language.

Words that weaken intent or retreat into uncertainty dilute the fiction.

**Don’t use: Unless in Character**

- *seems to*  
- *kind of*  
- *sort of*  
- *like(ly)*  
- *probably has*  
- *maybe / may be*

These create vague, non-committal statements that muddle the narrative.

### Avoid permission-seeking phrasing.

This is collaborative fiction, not a classroom.

**Avoid: Unless in Character**

- *Can I/we…?*  
- *Could I/we…?*  
- *If I/we…?*

Instead, act with intention in the fiction:

- *“I vault the counter and tackle the suspect.”*  
- *“We survey the rooftops for movement.”*  
- *“I push through the locked door—tools in hand.”*

Declare your action. Let the mechanics respond.

### Minimize distractions.

Phones, side conversations, unrelated browsing, and background chatter break immersion and slow the game.  
Stay present, stay focused, and give the scene and your fellow players the attention they deserve.
